**Setup Guide**

- Files and Folders necessary to run the project:
        1. node_modules - install by running the npm command in terminal
        2. .env - Create a .env file in the root directory, add this line "ACCESS_TOKEN=KEYTOTHECHEST" and save
- Clear the browser storage for localhost:3000. Otherwise authentication using JWT won't work properly.
- Go this url: 'localhost:3000/login' and click on 'New User?'. Default username and password is now set to 'admin'
